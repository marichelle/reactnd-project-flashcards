# Mobile Flashcards Project

Mobile Flashcards is a mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app allows users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

Mobile Flashcards uses Expo, React Native, Redux, & React Navigation.

## Installation

Clone the repository and use `npm` or `yarn` to install the dependencies and run the application.

```bash
